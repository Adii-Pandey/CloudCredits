**Introduction**

What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. In the telecommunications industry, customers can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business experiences an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.
Individualized customer retention is challenging because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients.
Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

**Problem Statement**

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including:

-Store/branch visits

-Product purchase histories

-Customer service calls

-Web-based transactions

-Social media interactions


By addressing churn, businesses can not only preserve their market position but also grow and thrive. The more customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit.

**Dataset**

The project uses a telecommunications customer dataset containing various customer attributes and service information. The dataset includes features such as:

-Customer demographics

-Account information

-Service subscriptions

-Monthly charges

-Contract details

-Churn status (target variable)


**Project Objectives**
This project explores the data to answer key business questions:

What's the percentage of churned customers vs. customers that remain with active services?
Are there any patterns in churn customers based on gender?
Are there any patterns/preferences in churn customers based on the type of service provided?
What are the most profitable service types?
Which features and services are most profitable?
What factors contribute most to customer churn?
How can we predict customer churn with high accuracy?
